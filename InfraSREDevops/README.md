When we develop one function for mini project, it hasn't complex requirements for the system. Usually, we define the
feature, define logic and implement. </br>

It is also that feature, when it is deployed on a big product, a lot of problems arise beyond making sure it runs
correct. Ex: load capacity, high performance, resource optimization, DB and store is good when run long time, security,
money for this function, ... </br>

This problem is not simple, we need multi knowledge and skills to handle that, including three important skills: infra +
backend + clear requirement. </br>

This doc is my experience and understanding of infra. It has been compiled from many sources and from my work history.
It is free. I hope it helps someone in the process of developing a big project web app. I would be happy if that
happens. Relax and enjoy this doc. </br>
