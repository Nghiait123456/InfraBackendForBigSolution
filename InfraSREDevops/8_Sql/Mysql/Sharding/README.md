- [Benchmark mysql cluster](#BenchmarkMysqlCluster)


## Benchmark mysql cluster? <a name="BenchmarkMysqlCluster"></a>
Mysql cluster for very high reliability, fault tolerance and performance. MySQL Cluster 7.4 delivers massively concurrent NoSQL access - 200 Million reads per second using the FlexAsync benchmark. This was achieved with 32 (out of a maximum 48) data nodes, each running on a server with 2x Intel Haswell E5-2697 v3 CPUs. In Aws Aurora, a cluster with a few nodes can easily achieve several hundred thousand qps. </br>
